            <abstract>These data were created for planimetric and cartigraphic display and analysis.Revisions: Metro Townships boundaries are revised as documents are filed with the Lt. Governor's Office.4/18/2017 FIPS codes added for the new metro townships. MUNI_CODE attribute addes as a short ID for muni's that can be used in analysis.Data is current thru Dec. 31, 2020. Population Estimates are from April 1,2020 to July 1, 2021.</abstract>
            <purpose>These data were first created through a cooperative effort of the Lt. Governor's Office, Salt Lake County, and UGRC. All Metro Townships incorporated as of Jan. 1, 2017 are included.  Updates for further annexations and disconnections will be completed with the cooperative efforts of the  County and UGRC. Data was created from Incorporation documents with coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions sent to the Lt. Governor's Office, and porcessed by UGRC.  The result was more a physical cadastre than a legal one. In other words, this dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries as per surveyed description, but, rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical &amp; administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent).</purpose>
